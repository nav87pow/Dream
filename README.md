X-X EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT #-#

>>> Current Implementation >>>
Groq API Integration – The app communicates with a custom server that sends structured requests to Groq for dream interpretation and translation.
Strict Interpretation Rules – Groq follows fixed system instructions:
a.interpret the dream only based on the category + method the user selects,
b.no improvisation, no personal advice
c.always respond in the user's chosen language
d.return structured JSON (title, interpretation, tags, methodUsed).
-1-Category & Method Pipeline – A dream is interpreted only after the user selects a category and an interpretation method, ensuring controlled and consistent results.
-2-Re-interpretation Flow – Users can edit their dream and request an updated interpretation.
Groq updates the last interpretation instead of creating duplicates.
-3-Dynamic Tags – Groq extracts tags (people, objects, symbols) which the user can edit or extend.
-4-Live Translation System – The entire app can switch languages.
Groq provides translations for missing UI keys and for the interpretation itself based on the user's selected language.



Hello, you are visiting an experimental project between myself and myself ^.-

I'm examining how AI works in the backend side useing Groq and Render server, with the help of its cool abilities, I can develop cool things, give it instructions and perhaps do some commands

unfortunately there's no design yet here for anyone who wanted to see some beautiful and attractive things

it'll come SOON don't worry >.<
 
 but in the meantime, I'm examining how to implement and give commands to AI 
 a little patience and this project will be cool ^.^ 
 maybe for you too, and not just for me  -.^
